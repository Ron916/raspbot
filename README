Raspbot!  For Raspberry Pi.

Just a skeleton app for a wifi based raspberry pi.

Wanting to add ability to receive commands via wifi web host to control the pi.

Raspbot currently has a Debian build called Raspbian installed version something or other

Running python 3.2.3

raspbot.py is run @boot so we can put all brain code in there

php webserver files are in /public

php delivered html is powered by jquery/bootstrap & angular.js, app.js has a skeleton app of sorts

todo:  move web from php to python flask :)
